### Using the SAM Data Extract
(Using SAM Data Extracts summary language here...) We have refreshed the test files for all of the daily monthly extracts.The data is from the SAM production envornment and has been scrubbed to eliminate all identifiable information from acutal entities. You can find the specific test file for your needs by looking at the files name below. Each sensitivity level and either the daily run or monthly run is indicated by the name of the file.

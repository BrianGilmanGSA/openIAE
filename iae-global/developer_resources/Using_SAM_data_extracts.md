### Using the SAM Data Extracts
SAM hosts extract files for both Entity Management and Excluded Party Data. You can get these files from two sources:<br>
1. SFTP - [Click here](https://github.com/GSA/IAE-Architecture/blob/master/as-is/tech-docs/SAM/Guide%20to%20Downloading%20SAM%20Extracts%20via%20SFTP%20Site.pdf?raw=true) for How to Download SAM Extracts from the SFTP server<br>
2. SAM.gov webiste. Go to SAM.gov under the "Data Access" area. <br>

SAM Extract files are available at three access levels:<br>
1. Public (includes name, address, Point of Contact information, etc.)<br>
2. For Official Use Only (FOUO) (includes certain types of Point of Contact Information and Federal Hierarchy information)<br>
3. Sensitive (includes banking information and MPIN)

If you require either FOUO or Sensitive levels of access you will need to add a role to your SAM account. To do that (link needed) click here for instructions.

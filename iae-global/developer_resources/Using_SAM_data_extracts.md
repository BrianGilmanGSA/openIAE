### Using the SAM Data Extract

New!! Exclusions Extracts User Guide:
https://www.sam.gov/sam/transcript/SAM_Exclusions_Extract_User_Guide.pdf
 
We have put out refreshed test files and updates to the mapping documentation for SAM Extracts.  The version is v1.0.
 
A note on version:  With this last round of updates to the documentation we have baselined both our documentation and extract/web service releases. We have baselined to v1.0.  All SAM extract files and web service WSDLs are now at v1.0. 
 
UPDATE: re-posted SAMExtractMappingsv1.0 on 5/19/2014  - no changes except to the names of the actual excel files from v5.1 to v1.0.

We have not made any major changes either the file layouts or the web service request/response structure or WSDLs since the intital rollout in May, 2013. 

We will use a standard 1.x.x (Major, Minor, Revision) for versioning going forward.
Version number currently is not reflected in either the header or footers of extract files.
We will begin to incorporate version number into file headers with a future major release. 
No major relase of SAM extracts is planned as of now. Any new release proposal would go through IAE govenance.
 
SAMExtractMappingsv1.0 has all of the documentation updates. Please look at the first tab, "Change Log" to review the changes in the documenation.
 
We also have refreshed the test files for all of the daily monthly extracts.The data is from the SAM production envornment and has been scrubbed to eliminate all identifiable information from acutal entities. You can find the specific test file for your needs by looking at the files name below. Each sensitivity level and either the daily run or monthly run is indicated by the name of the file.

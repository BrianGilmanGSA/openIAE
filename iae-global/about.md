### About IAE

The Integrated Award Environment (IAE) is a Presidential E-Government initiative managed by the General Services Administration (GSA). The IAE uses innovative processes and technologies to improve systems and operations for those who award, administer, or receive federal financial assistance (i.e., grants, loans), contracts, and intergovernmental transactions.


#### Mission, Vision, Values, Business/Technical Collaboration Principles

"The IAE Mission is to support a common, secure business environment which facilitates and supports cost-effective acquisition of, and payment for, goods and services; effective management of federal acquisition and assistance awards; and consistent transparency into federal acquisition and assistance awards.

The IAE Vision is to continue to evolve and integrate the existing shared portfolio of 10 electronic systems used for awarding and administering federal financial assistance (i.e., grants, loans) and contracts. The largest and most complex of the E-Government initiatives, the IAE works on behalf of the acquisition and financial assistance communities to save money, be more efficient, reduce burdens on the communities we serve, and improve federal award management.


The IAE Values include employing agile business and systems processes in order to:
   * Drive continuous innovation and improvement;        
   * Serve as active and engaged stewards of federal award data;         
   * Enable collaboration across the federal government;
   * Protect the quality and integrity of the data; and
   * Embrace openness and transparency."

#### Governance 
The following bodies provide overall direction and guidance and coordinating support to facilitate the mission of the IAE including:

__Award Committee for E-Government (ACE)__

"An advisory and decision making body with responsibility for strategic planning and functional governance of the IAE portfolio of systems.

The ACE responsibilities include strategic planning; providing a disciplined process and approach to decisions, priorities, and community needs for the IAE systems; resolving conflicts in priorities from other elements of the governance process; and identifying policy or other considerations for OMB decision or actions. The ACE also is responsible for approving algorithms and associated funding levels required of the line of business partners. 

The ACE consists of senior leaders from both the procurement and financial assistance communities, as well as representatives from the Office of Management and Budget and other non-voting Advisor Agencies."

__Financial Assistance Committee for E-Government (FACE)__
The functional community group that is dedicated to addressing the needs of the federal financial assistance community as it pertains to collecting, using, disseminating, and displaying federal financial assistance data.

__Procurement Committee for E-Government (PCE)__	The PCE represents the functional needs of the procurement and broader acquisition community, and it serves as the community voice for data collection, reporting, and the analysis of the outcomes expected from the IAE portfolio of systems. This group will resolve any decisions regarding scope or other issues arising from the IAE systems unique to federal procurement.

__GSA Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO)__	In co-lead with GSAâ€™s Federal Acquisition Service (FAS), the GSA Chief Information Office is responsible for the development and operation of IAE.

__GSA Federal Acquisition Service (FAS) IAE Program Office__	The GSA FAS office that executes and manages IAE operations.

__IAE Change Control Board (CCB)__	"The CCB is the decision-making body for proposed change requests that affect IAE systems. 

Administered by GSA/IAE, the CCB is comprised of voting representatives from each of the CFO Act federal agencies. It is responsible for making decisions about IAE that improve award management for acquisition, grants, loans and life-cycle performance across the federal space. 

The CCB affects integration of IAE across functional areas and meets statutory and regulatory requirements."

####IAE Principles	
IAE operates under a set of principles to ensure our work is focused, productive, and mission-driven.
The IAE Architectural Principles	"In making decisions about contracting, business processes, architecture, and other planning, IAE and its partners will consider our Architectural Principles.

These principles serve as guideposts for decision-making at all levels; everything from strategy through implementation. These principles will be used to distinguish IAE from other programs and from our own history.

It is important to recognize that these Principles are not hard and fast rules - in fact they are frequently in tension with each other. The best technical solution for IAE will balance these Principles for the benefit of the government and IAE system users.

#####The Principles:
 - IAE Must be Open
 - We Must Always Treat Data as an Asset
 - We Will Use Continuous Improvement to Drive Innovation
 - IAE Will Provide an Effective User Experience for All Stakeholders
 - Business Transactions Must be Time- and Cost-Measurable
 - IAE Will Treat Security as Foundational
 - We Will Build Value Over Maintianing the Status Quo"

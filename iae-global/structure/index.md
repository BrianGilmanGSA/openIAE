### Structure Overview

__iae-global__ acts as the definitive public repository for architecture, design and code artifacts for the US General Services Administration (GSA) Integrated Award Environment (IAE). This repository is the initial release and contains limited information.

### Contacting IAE

General information about the IAE is available at [gsa.gov](www.gsa.gov/iae). The IAE Program Office communicates regularly through the GSA Interact site. General questions concerning the IAE Program can be directed to iaeoutreach@gsa.gov.

### Organization
This repository is split into two main areas
 - Material describing the As-Is IAE systems. Material in this section refers to the existing applications - fpds.gov, fbo.gov, sam.gov and others.
 - Materials describing the To-Be environment including architecture, design and all the artifacts required to create a working non-production IAE application.
 
#### Architecture
The As-Is and To-Be archirecture materials are organized in a TOGAF-based structure, namely
 - Business Architecture
 - Data Architecture
 - Application Architecture
 - System Architecture
 - Vision
 
#### Design and Code
In addition to the architecture materials, the repository contains placeholders for the design and code. These components will be populated as the development process progresses.

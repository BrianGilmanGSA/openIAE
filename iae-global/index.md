### Overview

<p>The IAE Global Repository acts as the definitive public repository for architecture, design and code artifacts for the US General Services Administration (GSA) Integrated Award Environment (IAE). </p>
<p>This repository is the initial release and contains limited information. As the development process progresses, design and code will be added on a rolling basis.</p>

### Contacting IAE
General information about IAE is available at gsa.gov. The IAE Program Office communicates regularly through the [IAE Industry Community](https://interact.gsa.gov/group/integrated-award-environment-iae-industry-community) on the GSA Interact site. General questions concerning the IAE Program can be directed to iaeoutreach@gsa.gov.

 * Material describing the As-Is IAE systems: Material in this section refers to the existing applications, including fpds.gov, fbo.gov, and sam.gov
 * Material describing the To-Be environment: Material in this section includes the architecture, design, and artifacts required to create a working non-production IAE application

 
#### Architecture
The As-Is and To-Be archirecture materials are organized in a TOGAF-based structure,
* Business Architecture
* Data Architecture
* Application Architecture
* System Architecture
* Vision
 
#### Design and Code
In addition to the architecture materials, the repository contains placeholders for the design and code. These components will be populated as the development process progresses.

#About
This document is part of the iae-global repository found at github.com/GSA/iae-global. 

The document identifies, describes and defines the Architecture Principles for the Integrated Award Environment (IAE).  

#Architectural Principles
IAE has established the following six Architectural Principles

 - IAE must be open
 - IAE must treat data as an asset
 - IAE must use continuous improvement to drive innovation
 - IAE must provide an effective user experience for all its stakeholders
 - IAE business transaction must be time- and cost-measurable; and
 - IAE must treat security as foundational

IAE recognizes that these Principles can be in conflict and seeks to find an optimal balance between competing principles.

##Explanation of Principles

Principle | Implications
----------|-------------
IAE must be open | Open source IAE code where possible; Use open source tools; Provide open access to IAE data; All IAE business functions are also open
IAE must treat data as an asset | Significant focus on managing data quality; implementors must have data-oriented SLAs; Change control of the data needs to be transparent; Will follow the data->information->knowledge chain
IAE must use continuous improvement to drive innovation | Agile development – frequent, controlled releases with high stakeholder engagement; Design in flexibility – policy changes should be easier to implement
IAE must provide an effective user experience for all its stakeholders | Constant engagement with users; Understand the personae of our stakeholder community; Actively choose which groups are of priority
IAE business transaction must be time- and cost-measurable | Granular business process definition; Strong understanding of internal and external dependencies; Transactions are built to be cost-measurable; Can become a fee-for-service organization
IAE must treat security as foundational | Design security into each transaction and data store; Continuous evaluation of security posture

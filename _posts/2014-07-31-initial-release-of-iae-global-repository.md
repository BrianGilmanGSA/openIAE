{post.title}

The U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) Integrated Award Environment (IAE) is pleased to join the GitHub community with the IAE Global Repository. The repository will initially contain existing applications such as fpds.gov, fbo.gov, and sam.gov.

In the future, architecture, design, and artifacts for the future environment will be added to the repository, presenting an exciting opportunity to both share IAE work product to benefit our stakeholders, and to obtain valuable feedback from the developer community.

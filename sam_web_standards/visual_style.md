# Visual Style

## Use US Web Standards Forâ€¦

For the following the SAM Web Standards do not modify the US Web Standards:

* [grid](https://playbook.cio.gov/designstandards/grids/),
* [buttons](https://playbook.cio.gov/designstandards/buttons/),
* [labels](https://playbook.cio.gov/designstandards/labels/),
* [tables](https://playbook.cio.gov/designstandards/tables/),
* [alerts](https://playbook.cio.gov/designstandards/alerts/),
* [accordions](https://playbook.cio.gov/designstandards/accordions/),
* [colors](https://playbook.cio.gov/designstandards/visual-style/#colors),
* [search bar](https://playbook.cio.gov/designstandards/search-bar/), and
* [side navigation](https://playbook.cio.gov/designstandards/sidenav/).

## Logo and Usage

[insert logo pages from branding style guide]

## Typography

The *SAM Web Standards* follows the *US Web Standards* with regard to [typography](https://playbook.cio.gov/designstandards/visual-style/#typography) and uses the Source Sans Pro [pairing and style](https://playbook.cio.gov/designstandards/visual-style/#pairings).

## Colors

The *SAM Web Standards* follows the *US Web Standards* [color palette](https://playbook.cio.gov/designstandards/visual-style/#palette) as a base for color decisions. Further, the *SAM Web Standards* defines the following colors as suitable content background colors.

<div class="usa-grid-full usa-color-row usa-primary-color-section">
  <div class="usa-color-square usa-color-white">
    <div class="usa-color-inner-content">
      <p class="usa-color-hex">#ffffff</p>
      <p class="usa-color-name">white</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="usa-color-square usa-color-white">
    <div class="usa-color-inner-content">
      <p class="usa-color-hex">need light green background color</p>
      <p class="usa-color-name">light green hex and iae-style</p>
    </div>
  </div>  
</div>
## Imagery

You have the ability to surf the Internet on multiple devices, with multiple resolutions (low, medium, high, extra high, and so on), and the ability to make the browser almost any size you want. It is disappointing when a site dictates how you should use it or when the graphics are fuzzy because they are not accounting for the resolution capabilities of my display.
 * Use Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) when possible, especially flat artwork
 * Use Portable Network Graphics (PNG) for flat artwork, images with transparency, or photographs
 * Create and save images at 100 pixels per inch and two times the rendered dimensions; this does not apply to SVG
 * Avoid imagery not directly related to the content being presented
 * Avoid clip art style images.

## Animation

The Internet, as a platform, has come a very long way in a very short time, relatively speaking. The modern Web holds few boundaries when it comes to what can be accomplished; however, just because something can be done, does not mean it should be done.

Gratuitous animations that do not contribute to user feedback and goals become annoying, causing a speed bump. Animated graphics (or static imagery) that does not aid the communication of the content are distracting and make it difficult to navigate the site. The Web, generally speaking, is a silent world.  Sound (even as part of a video) should be optional.

For each page you should ask yourself, "What is the primary purpose of this page? What is the secondary purpose? What are the tertiary purposes? What is here that gets in the way of those purposes?"

## Form Controls and Standards

This section is written as an addition to the US Web Standards [form controls](https://playbook.cio.gov/designstandards/form-controls/) section. Therefore, please start there before continuing to gain a basic understanding before continuing here.

### Selection

To accommodate multiple types of device input, it is recommended that you minimize the amount of typing inputs placed within forms. Therefore, maximize the use of multiple choice of standard responses.

# Components

## Header

The header consists of the branded home button, main navigation, and application navigation elements (only when within an application). The branded home button consists of the transition.SAM.gov logo with a link to https://transition.SAM.gov/ allowing users to go to https://transition.SAM.gov from anywhere within the site.

### Unauthenticated

### Authenticated

### Category Navigation

The category navigation allows each service to create pages within the category’s area within transition.SAM.gov. For example, https://transition.SAM.gov/wages/resources would be a page consisting of links to resources related to Wage Determinations and available within the Category Navigation element when a user is anywhere within https://transition.SAM.gov/wages.

Note: The Category Navigation component is a sub-component of the [Header]({{ site.baseurl }}/sam_web_standards/components/#header).

## Footer

The SAM Web Standards uses the "big footer" defined by the *US Web Design Standards* as a base.

## Form Controls

The *SAM Web Standards* makes use of the [form controls](https://playbook.cio.gov/designstandards/form-controls/) from the *US Web Standards*. See the *US Web Design Standards* for form templates related to name, address, sign-in, and password reset [form controls](https://playbook.cio.gov/designstandards/form-controls/).

**Mobile Consideration:** Data entry on a mobile (handheld, phone, and so on) device can be tedious; therefore, when designing and developing forms, minimize the use of text input fields and large text areas.

### Text Input
<div class="preview">
  <div class="usa-input-error">
    <label class="usa-input-error-label">Title</label>
    <span class="usa-input-error-message" id="title-input-error" role="alert">The alert needs a title.</span>
    <input type="text" name="title" required="required"aria-describedby="title-input-error" />
    <span class="usa-form-hint">The <strong>bold</strong> text at the beginning of the alert.</span>
  </div>
</div>



### Application/Category Search Forms

Most of the applications/categories within SAM, use search forms to retrieve data related to an application/category. The forms accommodate text-based search as well as the optional application of filters. Filters are applied using a dropdown menu of options; multiple selections are allowed. Users can then deselect identified filters.

### Application/Category Filter

Used on pages where content spans multiple applications wherein a front-end user may wish to include or exclude any of the content related to the applications.

## Search Result

Used to display an individual result within a list of search results. Contains content information/summary and metadata related to the content. Metadata generally represent optional filters, which can be applied by the user, and are grouped together to easily discern between result content and metadata.

## Pagination

The pagination element is used in circumstances where the content being displayed cannot be accommodated in a single page (search results, for example). If JavaScript is enabled, continuous scrolling methods can be used in place of the pagination element; however, this element should exist in case JavaScript is disabled.

## Widgets

The *SAM Web Standards* uses the ________ standard [link to reference](). "Widgets are an essential aspect of home screen customization. You can imagine them as "at-a-glance" views of an app's most important data and functionality that is accessible right from the user's home screen."

## Confirmation and Acknowledgement

The *SAM Web Standards* uses the alert concepts from the *US Web Standards* as a base.

### Confirmation (prior to action)

Confirming is asking the user to verify that they truly want to proceed with an action they just invoked. In some cases, the confirmation is presented along with a warning or critical information related to the action that they need to consider.

### Acknowledgement (following action)

Acknowledging is displaying text to let the user know that the action they just invoked has been completed. This removes uncertainty about implicit operations that the system is taking. In some cases, the acknowledgment is presented along with an option to undo the action.

## Icons

The application of standard icons follows the guidance of [Font Awesome](https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icons/) for common icons.

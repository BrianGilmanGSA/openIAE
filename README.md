This repository contains all the architecture, design and code artifacts required to understand the functional definition of IAE, the design and ultimate technical implementation. It includes everything required to build a production environment for IAE, or smaller limited capability environments for the support of development, test or demo activities.

The repository is split into two separate sections. The __as-is__ contains materials related to the pre-transformation systems. The __to-be__ contains architecture, design and code covering for the new transformed environment.
